# Version Control
Version control allows you to work with different versions of a project or repository or a file, and you can find the history of changes or record of changes about what changes has been made and by who, and we can go back to old versions and track modifications and correct files.
### Types of VCSs
there are three types of version control systems, the first is the local version control, the changes that are made on files in this type are stored only on your hard disk database. The second type is the centralized version control system and it is the VCS where a developer team can work on a file or a set of files and the changes are stored on one server and every indivisual of the team can access it. The third type is the distributed version control systems in which all thee work is done and stored on servers which is connected so a centra database and local hard disks.

# Git
**Git** is developed by Linux Kernel project. And it  is a DVCS that stores data in system made made of snapshots, and there's a snapshot stored for every version, but it relies in the first place on information that is on local resources and every change or modification is recorded, and data can't be easily lost because there's something called mirrored repositories.
# Worflow
We start by cloning a code from git to our terminal then edit the code by a text editor and then execute ACP which is adding committing and pushing the changes by the terminal to Github and the nw version transferes to Github.
# Remote Repositories
The work on Git is done on remote repositories that are online or on a network and you can push data to them and pull fro them after cloning repositories from the origin to the local branch the *Master*.
