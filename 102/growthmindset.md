# Growth Mindset
**Growth mindset** is a mindset you have that pushes you dive deeply into something you love and interested in and makes you seek all its details and whenever you are interested in a field or something you feel like you can start learning and you look for resources and you dont feel stuck in doing your same old things, skills or jobs, you will even be ready for a career shifting.
### How can i stay in a growth mindset?
1. Remember that doing the same things and staying in my comfort zone will not help me to make any progress.
2. Remember that even i can face hard times and feel hopeless but as much effort i give as much good results i will get.
3. Remember that **time is going to pass anyway** so why not spend it in doing things that will benefit me for now and the future.
