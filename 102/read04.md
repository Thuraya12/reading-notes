#### How JavaScript makes webpages more interactive 
JS makes webpages more interactive by accessing content and modifiying it via selecting elements, attributes or text from HTML text. And you can modify content by adding or deleting elements, attributes and text.And by javascript we can program rules which are instructions for the browser to follow and it can react to events.

**JavaScript** enables you to change html page content while it is loaded in the browser by accessing the content, modifying it, programming rules and reacting to events. These steps enable a website to reload a part of a page and filter a page data to show onl the information that a user needs.

Vraiables are case-sensitive ,though you cant use the same name starting with different initiala twice, and the first letter of every other word must be capital letter.
# Arrays
Arrays are used with lists to know items which will be used. Arrays are written with square brackets and has a list inside, and items are seperated with commas.
#  Basic JavaScript instructions 
we can add a javascript file to an html file by writing javascript code in it's own file and linking the file to the html file by using script tag and adding the js file link to the tag attribute. But we can put javascript code directly in the same html file without seperating it.

 There are alot of useful things to use such as an alert, document element and prompt that make interactive pages using helpful tools such as operartors, variables, strings and numbers.
