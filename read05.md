## Comparison and Logical Operators
###### page 150, 151, 156, and 157

**Comparison** operators compare a value to its expected input to evaluate conditions and the result of this comparison is a Boolean.Comparison operators are: (== is equal to ,and=== strict equal to)both of them compare two values but is equal to checks if they have the same value and the strict equal to checks if they have the same value and data type. and (!= is not equal to, and !== strict not equal to) they check if the two values are not the same but != checks if they have the same value and !== checks if they have the same value and data type.
Also there is >greater than and < less than, and >= greater than or equal to and <= less than orequal to.
**Logical operators** allows you to compare more than one comparison operator results. There is the logical and &&, it givs the value of true if both expresions evaluate to true, and there is the logical OR|| which returns true if one of the expresions evaluate true, and the last one is the logical not! which gives the opposite of the expression result without the ! before it.

## For and while loops
###### page 170, 173, and 176
A **Loop** is re-running the code again and again  as well as the value is true until the value returns false it breaks out of the loop. JavaScript has For loop and While loop.The for loop is the most known loop and it's used to run a code multiple times. While loop is used when the code is going to run many times but you dont know how many times exactly, as it may depend on user input and as long as the value is true.
The variable **i** can be used inside a loop and we can increment to it or decrement from it.
