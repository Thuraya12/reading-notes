## Chapter 2: “Text” (pp.40-61)
We add tags(markup) to html page content to give meaning to the content, and there is structural markup and semantic markup.
Visual editors "resemble word processors" as mentioned in Jon Duckett javascript book in page 49, and they are used for modifying the style and formatting of the text(text look). Code views is something that shows you the code created by visusl editor and allow you to edit iand code.

## Chapter 10: “Introducing CSS” (pp.226-245)

**CSS** is used to control the styling and apearance of web pages so it's a part of the front end.CSS contains block level elements such as <p> <h1> and <div>, and inline elements such as <img> and <em>. CSS rules can be applied to HTML elements to determin how they look. A CSS rule has two parts a *Selector* and it is the name of the tag that will be styled, and a *Declaration* which is how the elements should be styled and it is written inside curly braces and has two parts, properties and values and you can use several properties seperted by semi colons. CSS selectors are case sinsitive, and if you have two identical rules for the same selector the last one has the priority to run.
#### How to add CSS to HTML
This can be done enternally or externally.We can link an external CSS file where you write all your css code seprately, to an html file using <link> tag in the html file. And we can write css code enternally in the html using <style> tag.

## Chapter 2: “Basic JavaScript Instructions” (pp.53-84)
The script can be placed in the same html file using script tag as an internal script or write script in a separate file and link it to the html file as an external script.javascript code is sensitive towards its place in the code, when it as in beginning it runs firstly and when at the end the whole code runs before it. variables are the parts that gets assigned a specific information so we can go back to it whenever we need it and every time it runs it stores differnt or varied data.
We can declare variables by writing the variable name,the assignment operator= and the variable value.
Different data types can be be assigned to variables such as strings numbers and booleans(true or false).there are different types of operator such as arithmetic operators *, assignment operators= , comparison operators > < , and logical operators such as the and & and or || and string operators.

## Chapter 4: “Decisions and Loops” only up to the section on switch statements (pp.145-162)
## Functions

Functions group statements to achieve a task and store code until it's needed we can call whenever we want thus we make code reusable. A function declaration is made by typing the function keyword first and then the function name and parantheses, and inside these paranthese we can add a parameter , after them we type the statements inside curly brackets.And we call it by its name afollowd by paranthese in which we can add argument for the parameter.

**Desicion Making** in script is made so the browser knows what code to run and this can be done by writing conditions.
A **Loop** is re-running the code again and again  as well as the value is true until the value returns false it breaks out of the loop. JavaScript has For loop and While loop.The for loop is the most known loop and it's used to run a code multiple times. While loop is used when the code is going to run many times but you dont know how many times exactly, as it may depend on user input and as long as the value is true.
The variable **i** can be used inside a loop and we can increment to it or decrement from it.
