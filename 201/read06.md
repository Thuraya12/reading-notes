## From the Duckett JS book

## Chapter 3: “Object Literals” (pp.100-105)
**Objects** combine functions and variables to create models of things. In objects, Functions are called methods and variables are called properties, and properties are about general information and methods perform tasks.The names of properties and methods are called keys, and keys must have unique names and 2 keys shouldn't share the same name. In the objects name/value pairs are used widely which can come in arrays, functions and variables, and it's not only for javascript, it exists in HTML and CSS as well. We can access the value of a properties and methods using the dot notation which indicates writing the object name and then a dot whic is callled a member operator and then the name of the method or property whaich is a member of the object. 

## Chapter 5: “Document Object Model” (pp.183-242)
The **DOM** is Document Object Model, and it determines what part of the page runs while the website is still showing and without leaving the page so it updates content in a specific part only.The DOM is a group of rules that is known for the common browsers and it's made of objects.It's also called an API(Application programming Interface) because it's used to make pages interactive.
When the web browser loads a page it creates a dom tree for it and stores it in the browser's memory.
To update the DOM tree we must access the html elements and then working on these elements.
**DOM Queries** are methods that find the elements so changes apply to them, so it finds the selected elements and then looks for its node and the works on it. We save elements in the dom tree using elements in variables and we can find elements using the queries wheather uou are lokking for one element or a whole list of them and there are selectors for selecting one element such as *getElementById()* and *querySelector()*, we can also use the ID attribute to select elements. If we want to select more than one element we select a **Node List** which is a kind of object.
