knowing how documents are structured is important for building websites. Documents are text structered in a readable meaningful well-formatted way by using headings and subheadings for sectioning. Documents written using html are similsr to paper documents and sometimes they can be an electronic version of it such as a newspaper website and insurance forms.Structure is added to webpages as in word documents,a main heading with the important information paragraph following it and subheadings with the secondary or detailed information. In Html the document structure is described by code, the code consists of elements which has openeing and closing tags e.g( p , /p) written inside angular brackets and inside them goes the content that appears on the web page, and these elements determin the page structure and tell us about the kind of content that they include. Attribute provide more information about the content and they have two parts a name and a value, e.g( lang="en"). They main tags in html are (!DOCTYPE html) which includes that we're using html5 version and <(html) tag which means that this is an html code and  (head) which contains (title) tag that sets the tab title and the (body)which contains (header) (main) and  (footer)as main parts, and to wtite web pages using html we need a text editor to write code and a web browser to render the code.

Form the beginning of the web html developed through different versions and web browsers as well, and with every update new features and tags and elements are added and ones are deleted, for example html4 had some styling elements which were removed in html5 and done with css instead.before HTML5 XML language that is for writing markup appeared and put strict rules in coding and html adopted it and made XHTML version then html5 came and it is still uncomplete. To determin what version we are using we use (!DOCTYPE html) tag at the beginning of every html file.
**Comments** are used in coding to tell something about the code and it doesnt appeare on the rendered page its only for people who read the sorce code to explain it to them. **ID attribute** is used to give a class a unique identity so we can style them separately and it can't be shared in two elements unlike **class attribute** which is for the same purpose but multiple elements can share it.
**Block elements** are elements that create a new line for it's content but **Inline elements** keep writing on the same line, but we can collect a number of them to form a block.
**Iframe** is used to imbed another html page within your webpage such as a map or any page inside or outside the site server.**meta** tag is used to tell important information about the website such as the writer of it and it is placed in the head. There are characters called **escape characters** and can be written using codes such as the less and greater than signs, copy right symbol and registered trademark.
