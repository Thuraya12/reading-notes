## Domain Modeling
Domain modeling is creating a model to describe a code implementations and attributes and behaviors and obsticles.object-oriented models are the models that have properties stored in them and methods that has a function in them. Domain Modeling is very helful to determin how to work on a problem, and it is a mean of communication that makes it easier to define termonology to technical and non technical teams that are working together.

## From the Duckett HTML book:

## Chapter 6: “Tables” (pp.126-145)
A lot of things can be described in tables, a table is a form of displaying content in rows and columns which devides the table to **Table Cells**.
To write a table in html we need to use table tag and write the table row by row, to start a raw we use **tr** tag and we ue **td** tag for cells inside each row, and we use **th**tag to make the table headings.
We can use spanning for columns and rows to make the table stretch in multiple columns and rows using **colspan** and **rowspan**. There are some table styling tags that were used in old codes and we mustn't use anymore because they are replaced in css now such as width and cellpadding for adding space and border and background. 

## From the Duckett JS Book:
## Chapter 3: “Functions, Methods, and Objects” (pp.106-144)
We can create blank objects using the keyword **new** and the object constructor, and then add methods and properties to it. We can update properties values  using dot notation and brackets and we can delete them. Using the object constructor we can create multiple objects inside a function.
A new object can be added using the new keyword followed by a function call.
**This** keyword id very common and its meaning differs according to where it comes or inside which function. A function in global scope is not written within an object or a function but at the very beginning of the code so it can be accessible to all functions and objects and any elemetns in the code.
Name/Value pairs are used to store data in javascript using variables and arrays.
