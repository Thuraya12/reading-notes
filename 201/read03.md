## Chapter 3: “Lists” (pp.62-73)
There are three types of **Lists**, *Ordered list* whichs is numbered,* Unordered List* which is un-numbered and starts with bullets, and *difinition Lists* which are used to make a list of terms to define them.we can nest lists inside eacother to make sub-lists that get indented and a new ul style is added. 


## Chapter 13: “Boxes” (pp.300-329)
CSS deals with each HTML element as a box and use these boxes to control and change the content appearence such as sitting the width and height dimensions, add boarders, margins, and paddings, or you can show boxes or hide them. controling dimensions of**height** and **width** can be done using pixels, percentage, and ems, The last two ways are very useful for website flexibility so it functions swith the same quality on different devices ans screen sizes such as the min and max- width and min and max-height.**Overflow** is used when there's no enough space on the page because container element is smaller than the content, we can use overflow :hidden to hide the extra content or overflow :scroll to creat a scroll  bar to see the rest of the content. 
Every box has a **border** that surrounds it, a **margin** outside it to seperate it from other boxes, and a padding to make enough space between the content and the border. To center boxes use margin-left and margin-right.
we can hide or show elements using hidden and visible elements.

## Review from Reading 02 - Chapter 2: “Basic JavaScript Instructions” (pp.70-73)
We can set the script in the same html file using script tag as an internal script or write script in a separate file and link it to the html file as an external script.in javascript it is important to be careful about where code is place , when it as in beginning it runs firstly and when at the end the whole code runs before it. variables are the parts that gets assigned a specific information so we can go back to it whenever we need it and every time it runs it stores differnt or varied data.
We can declare variables by writing the variable name,the assignment operator= and the variable value.
Different data types can be be assigned to variables such as strings numbers and booleans(true or false).there are different types of operator such as arithmetic operators *, assignment operators= , comparison operators > < , and logical operators such as the and & and or || and string operators.

## Chapter 4: “Decisions and Loops” from switch statements on (pp.162-182)

Functions group statements to achieve a task and store code until it's needed we can call whenever we want thus we make code reusable. A function declaration is made by typing the function keyword first and then the function name and parantheses, and inside these paranthese we can add a parameter , after them we type the statements inside curly brackets.And we call it by its name afollowd by paranthese in which we can add argument for the parameter.

**Desicion Making** in script is made so the browser knows what code to run and this can be done by writing conditions.
A **Loop** is re-running the code again and again  as well as the value is true until the value returns false it breaks out of the loop. JavaScript has For loop and While loop.The for loop is the most known loop and it's used to run a code multiple times. While loop is used when the code is going to run many times but you dont know how many times exactly, as it may depend on user input and as long as the value is true.
The variable **i** can be used inside a loop and we can increment to it or decrement from it.
