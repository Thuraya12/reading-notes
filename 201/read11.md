#### Controlling size of images in CSS
We can control size of images using **width** and **height** properties in css or use class names are used that determins your pictures' sizes such as small, medium, and large and use them with the width and height properties. Specifying pictures width and height is good when rendering in the browser.
 ### Aligning images in CSS
 Images can be aligned using align attribute or using float property. We can center images by returning them from inline elements to block elements display: block; and then center them with text align property or using marging auto proprety.
 ### Adding background images
 Background images can be used behind any HTML element specifically, or for the whole body, it can be added by typing the selector and then background image property and then set a url with the image path, e.g.*body {backgroung-image: url('images/cat.jpg');}*. There is also a background-repeat property that can be used with four different values:
 1. repeat gets the background images image repeated horizontally and vertically.
 2. repeat-x : reapeats background images horizontally.
 3. repeat-y : repeats background images vertically.
 4. no-repeat: the background images apears once.

 Also we can use backgroung-attachment property with the value **fixed** to make the image stay in the same position when scrolling, or with the value **scroll** so it moves when we scroll. In addition, when ther's no repetition, we can use background-position property to determin the background image place in the browser.
