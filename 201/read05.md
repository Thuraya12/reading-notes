## Chapter 5: “Images” (pp.94-125)
**images are a very important part of the web and we add them for various reasons such as adding pictures related to the topic or content of the pageor for decorating or for logos or explanation.we can add images either on html or css and to choose the perfect picture we must make it fit with general design and colors and it must be meanigful and related to the topic, and there are stock photos to use and we can buy them online so we don't get in trouble for using others pictures.
The image appearance depends on where it is placed in the code. 



## Chapter 11: “Color” (pp.246-263)
**Colors** make pages better and more lovely, and  makes websites more attractive and css makes it easy to make your website colorful. There are three ways for writing clors in css, RGB Values, HEX Codes, and colors names. You can set a backgroung color using any of the three ways to the body element. Colors on computers are a mix of amounts of red, green, and blue and these mixtures can make hundreds of shades of colors, for that you can use a color picker.

In **RGB Vlaues** the colers red green and blue are measured from 0 to 255 so for example if we want red we type rgb(255, 0, 0) and the same idea for green and blue and for other colors we mix different amounts of these colors. In **HEX Codes** it is the  same but using hexadecimal code by writing a hash before a six digit code for red green and blue. For **Color Names** there are 147 colors that browsers support but it is hard to remember all the colors names.

The color hue is like color gradation and saturation is the amount of grey in the color ,and brightness is the amount of black in the color.when chosing background and font color there must be enough contrast between font color and background color to have a readable text, not too low and not too high contrast.Rgba adds opacity to rgb which represents transparancy.There is **HSL** colors represent hue, saturation and lightness which is the amount of white and there's hsla colors when opacity is added to them.


## Chapter 12: “Text” (pp.264-299)
We can change **Text** appearence  by using different font families such as Serif, Sans-Serif and Monospace and change font related features such as the size and style, using font-family and font-size properties and controlling the type scales according to our design, and scales can be measured using pixels, percentage, and ems.There are too many properties to control text alignment and styling and indenting provided in  css.
