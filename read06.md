# Introducing CSS

**CSS** is used to control the styling and apearance of web pages so it's a part of the front end.CSS contains block level elements such as <p> <h1> and <div>, and inline elements such as <img> and <em>. CSS rules can be applied to HTML elements to determin how they look. A CSS rule has two parts a *Selector* and it is the name of the tag that will be styled, and a *Declaration* which is how the elements should be styled and it is written inside curly braces and has two parts, properties and values and you can use several properties seperted by semi colons. CSS selectors are case sinsitive, and if you have two identical rules for the same selector the last one has the priority to run.
#### How to add CSS to HTML
This can be done enternally or externally.We can link an external CSS file where you write all your css code seprately, to an html file using <link> tag in the html file. And we can write css code enternally in the html using <style> tag.

# color
colors makes websites more attractive and css makes it easy to make your website colorful. There are three ways for writing clors in css, RGB Values, HEX Codes, and colors names. You can set a backgroung color using any of the three ways to the body element. Colors on computers are a mix of amounts of red, green, and blue and these mixtures can make hundreds of shades of colors, for that you can use a color picker.

In **RGB Vlaues** the colers red green and blue are measured from 0 to 255 so for example if we want red we type rgb(255, 0, 0) and the same idea for green and blue and for other colors we mix different amounts of these colors. In **HEX Codes** it is the  same but using hexadecimal code by writing a hash before a six digit code for red green and blue. For **Color Names** there are 147 colors that browsers support but it is hard to remember all the colors names.

The color hue is like color gradation and saturation is the amount of grey in the color ,and brightness is the amount of black in the color.when chosing background and font color there must be enough contrast between font color and background color to have a readable text, not too low and not too high contrast.Rgba adds opacity to rgb which represents transparancy.There is **HSL** colors represent hue, saturation and lightness which is the amount of white and there's hsla colors when opacity is added to them.
